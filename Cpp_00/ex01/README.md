# My Awesome PhoneBook - 42 ROMA LUISS

When the program starts, the user is prompted for input: you should accept the ADD command, the SEARCH command or the EXIT command. Any other input is discarded.
The program starts empty (no contacts), doesn’t use any dynamic allocation, and can’t store more than 8 contacts. If a ninth contact is added, replace the oldest contact.
• If the command is EXIT:
 ◦ The program quits and the contacts are lost forever.
• Else if the command is ADD:
 ◦ The program will prompt the user to input a new contact’s information, one field at a time, until every field is accounted for.
 ◦ A contact is defined by the following fields: first name, last name, nickname, phone number,darkest secret.
 ◦ The PhoneBook must be represented as as an instance of a class in your code it must contain an array of contact.
 ◦ A contact MUST be represented as an instance of a class in your code.
• Else if the command is SEARCH:
 ◦ The program will display a list of the available non-empty contacts in 4 columns: index, first name, last name and nickname.
 ◦ Each column must be 10 chars wide, right aligned and separated by a ’|’ character. Any output longer than the columns’ width is truncated and the last displayable character is replaced by a dot (’.’).
 ◦ Then the program will prompt again for the index of the desired entry and displays the contact’s information, one field per line. If the input makes no sense, define a relevant behavior.
• Else the input is discarded.
When a command has been correctly executed, the program waits for another ADD or SEARCH command until an EXIT command.
