# Megaphone - 42 ROMA LUISS

Just to be sure that everybody is awake, write a program that has the following behavior:
$>./megaphone "shhhhh... I think the students are asleep..."
SHHHHH... I THINK THE STUDENTS ARE ASLEEP...
$>./megaphone Damnit " ! " "Sorry students, I thought this thing was off."
DAMNIT ! SORRY STUDENTS, I THOUGHT THIS THING WAS OFF.
$>./megaphone
* LOUD AND UNBEARABLE FEEDBACK NOISE *
$>

(Use C++ style to interact with stdin!)
