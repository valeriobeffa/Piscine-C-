#  Serena, my love! - 42 Roma LUISS

Because we can’t ever have enough Claptraps, now you will make another one.
The class will be named ScavTrap, and will inherit from ClapTrap, the constructor, destructor, and attack have to use different outputs.
After all, a Claptrap has to have some measure of individuality.
The ScavTrap class will have its construction and destruction messages.
Also, proper construction/destruction chaining must be present (When you build a ScavTrap, you must start by building a ClapTrap...
Destruction is in reverse order), and the tests have to show it.
ScavTrap will use the attributes of Claptrap (You need to change Claptrap accordingly)! And must initialize them to:
 • Name (Parameter of constructor)
 • Hitpoints (100)
 • Energy points (50)
 • attack damage (20)
ScavTrap will also have a new specific function: void guardGate(); this function will display a message on the standard outputs to anounce that ScavTrap have enterred in Gate keeper mode.
Extend your main function to test everything.
