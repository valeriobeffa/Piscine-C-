# Repetitive work - 42 Roma LUISS

Making Claptraps is probably starting to get on your nerves.
Now, you will make a FragTrap class that inherits from ClapTrap.
 • Name (Parameter of constructor)
 • Hitpoints (100)
 • Energy points (100)
 • attack damage (30)
The FragTrap class will have its construction and destruction messages.
Also, proper construction/destruction chaining must be present (When you build a FragTrap, you must start by building a ClapTrap...
Destruction is in reverse order), and the tests have to show it.
The specific function for FragTrap will be void highFivesGuys(void) and will display a positive high fives request on the standard output.
Extend your main function to test everything.
