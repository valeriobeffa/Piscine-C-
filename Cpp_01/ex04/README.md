 Make a program called replace that takes a filename and two strings, let’s call them s1 and s2, that are NOT empty.
It will open the file, and write its contents to FILENAME.replace, after replacing every occurrence of s1 with s2.
All the member functions of the class std::string are allowed, except replace. Use them wisely!
Of course, you will handle errors as best you can. Do not use the C file manipulation.
