# Unnecessary violence - 42 Roma LUISS

Make a Weapon class, that has a type string, and a getType method that returns a const reference to this string. It also has a setType, of course!
Now, create two classes, HumanA and HumanB, that both have a Weapon, a name, and an attack() function that displays:
NAME attacks with his WEAPON_TYPE
HumanA and HumanB are almost-almost the same; there are only two details:
• While HumanA takes the Weapon in its constructor, HumanB doesn’t.
• HumanB may not always have a Weapon, but HumanA will ALWAYS be armed.
