# Moar brainz! - 42 Roma LUISS

Re-using the Zombie class, now we are going to create an horde of zombies!
Write a function that takes an integer N. When called, it allocates N Zombie objects.
It must allocate all the N Zombie objects in a single allocation.
Then, it should initialize each Zombie by giving to each one a name. Last, it should return the pointer to the first Zombie.
The function is prototyped as follows: Zombie* zombieHorde( int N, std::string name );
Submit a main to test that your function zombieHorde works as intended.
You may want to do so by calling announce() on each one of the Zombies.
Do not forget to delete ALL the Zombies when you donâ€™t need them anymore.
